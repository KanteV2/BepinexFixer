# BepinexFixer
Fixes BepInEx for the hit first-person movement VR game Gorilla Tag.


What does this tool do?

1. Creates a backup which has all of your old BepInEx files.
2. Deletes the non-working BepInEx folder.
3. Downloads the latest working verison of BepInEx off of GitHub and extracts it to your Gorilla Tag path.
4. Puts the old mods back into the plugins.

Currently, this only supports the Oculus Software and the Steam software. This only supports drives D:\ and C:\ (sadly).
